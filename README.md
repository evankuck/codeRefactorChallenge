# codeRefactorChallenge
Challenge 1 for MSU Full Stack Web Dev bootcamp
First challenge submitted for MSU's January Full Stack Web Development. Delayed from the first turn-in date of 02/13/22 due to a number of mitigating factors, including:
 - Misunderstandings of how to properly utilize Git, Git Bash, and GitHub
 - Unfortunate developments in my other non-work capacity, Grand Rapids Young Professionals. 
 - An overall underestimation of the time it would take to complete the activities adequately.
 All of this is being committed to this ReadMe, not as an excuse, but because I want to properly document my development as a software developer in the most realistic way possible. I hope to use this challenge as a lesson going forward.
